<h2>My Top Favourite Movies Right Now</h2>
<HR /> 

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>
I like this film because not only is it groundbreaking in so many different aspects of cinamatography, storywriting and casting, I feel that the way in which the father is written is both subtle and genius. His unwavering dedication to his family, his positivity, his vunerability and his gentle nature. He is written as sublty as his character presents himself. He is the unsung hero of the movie in my opinion.

<h3>Steven Universe</h3>
<p>
OK. I know that Steven Universe is both a TV show and a movie, but I truly feel that its worth mentioning. The unabashed emotional vunerability, the healthy support of community, the ability to see that no one is "Evil" or a "Villian", but instead that everyone is hurting in their own way. That everyone deserves care, support and understanding. That maybe what the world needs is more Stevens. I can't wait for my kid to be old enough to watch it.

<h3>Saw</h3>
<p>
OK, so I know this one might be a bit of a surprise given how emotional my first two picks were, but I really beleive that Saw was a truely groundbreaking horror film. It totally changed the horror movie genre. The shift inward to show the "evil" of the average person, the complicated, piramid scheme plot, the increadible twist. All while not relying on the typical horror tactics for envoking fear. A surprising lack of jump scares and gore. All around a great horror film that forever changed the genre.
